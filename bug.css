The following CSS rule targets all elements with the class "container":

.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

However, if you have nested elements with the same class, the inner "container" will inherit and overwrite the width from its parent.  If the inner container has a smaller width, the parent will still have the full width set, resulting in unexpected layout. This is because CSS is applied in a cascading manner, and the last declaration for a particular property will take precedence.
